### Course Description

This course will explore both threats to privacy and solutions to the data privacy problem. In the first half of the course, we will demonstrate that traditional approaches to protecting privacy, such as anonymization, are subject to powerful attacks that reveal individuals’ sensitive data. We will cover more recent approaches for protecting privacy, including k-anonymity and l-diversity. We will also discuss a variety of privacy enhancing technologies such as secure multi-party computation, zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption and Tor. The second half of the course will focus on the current de facto standard for data privacy—differential privacy (DP). We will cover fundamentals of DP, including its formal definitions, composition theorems and basic algorithms to satisfy DP. We will also cover the local model of DP which is used by industry to collect sensitive data from users. Time permitting, we will cover more advanced applications of DP including synthetic data generation and machine learning on private data. Coursework will include implementing privacy algorithms and running simulations using popular languages for data science such as Python and Julia. Prior background is not assumed.

### Textbooks and Other Materials

* No textbook is required. The following is the main reference book for differential privacy: 
    * [The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf), by C. Dwork and A. Roth, 2014
        * Reference textbook on differential privacy
* The following resources may also be useful for additional reading:
    * [Programming Differential Privacy](https://programming-dp.com/), by J. Near and C. Abuah, 2021
        * A book about differential privacy, for programmers
    * [Differential Privacy: A Primer for a Non-technical Audience](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/files/salil/files/differential_privacy_primer_nontechnical_audience.pdf), by A. Wood, M. Altman, A. Bembenek, M. Bun, M. Gaboardi, J. Honaker, K. Nissim, D. O’Brien, T. Steinke and S. Vadhan,  2018
        * Introduction to differential privacy for a non-technical audience, with many illustrating examples and discussions regarding legal aspects
    * [The Complexity of Differential Privacy](https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/files/privacytools/files/complexityprivacy_1.pdf), by S. Vadhan, 2017
        * Another textbook on differential privacy, with emphasis on computational aspects
* Lecture notes and supplemental materials
    * Lecture notes for each chapter, in PowerPoint format, as well as some relevant supplemental materials will be posted on [Brightspace](https://brightspace.binghamton.edu/) before lectures. Lecture notes do not substitute for class attendance, since (i) they do not contain all the details in terms of explanations and analyses and (ii) significant parts of lectures, including discussions and presentations, may not come from the lecture notes
* Additional materials will be added as appropriate
