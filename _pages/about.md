<p>I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Binghamton University. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Penn State University and BS in Mathematics from Zhejiang University. I have a second PhD in Mathematics from Binghamton University.</p>

<p>My research interests lie in the intersection of <b>privacy</b>, <b>security</b>, <b>machine learning</b> and <b>algorithmic fairness</b>. My current research focuses on differential privacy and its interactions with software security, formal verification, statistical inference and numerical optimization.</p>

<p><span style="color:red"><b>I'm looking for highly-motivated and outstanding PhD students. If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email with your CV.</b></span></p>
